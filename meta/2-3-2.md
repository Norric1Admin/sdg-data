  AGRIS - International System for Agricultural Science and Technology; CAP - Common Agriculture Policy; IAEG -  Inter-Agency and Expert Group; IFAD - International Fund for Agricultural Development. Food production industries are defined using Standard Industrial Classification 2003
  (SIC03) from 2000 to 2008 and Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07) from 2008 onwards. SIC03 - SIC division 01 and 05 are used. SIC07 - SIC division 01 and 03 are used. Low pay is defined as the value that is two-thirds of median hourly earnings and high pay is defined as the
  value that is 1.5 times median hourly earnings. For example, median hourly earnings for full-time employees in 2017 is £14.00, therefore low pay employees are considered to be anyone earning below two-thirds of £14.00, which is £9.33 and high pay full-time employees are those earning
  anything above 1.5 times £14.00, which is £21.00.
